# My learning strategy

I am of the opinion that anyone can learn anything if it's presented to them in a way that works with their learning style. ("The student didn't fail, the class failed them.")

So my strategy has usually been to either:

1. Find a teacher/tutorial that works for me
1. Use engineering to make my own thing that works for me

## The OS vids

I think my craziest example of the latter is what I did in my OS class. 

My professor posted each lecture as a video recording to the class website, and initially I just watched each one.

But then I started thinking it'd be better if the videos were broken down into smaller topic videos instead of hour-long monoliths.

I ended up making [this thing](https://github.com/sgatewood/os_vids) that pretends to chop up the videos.

Huh, maybe I can still deploy this thing [here](/os_vids)...
