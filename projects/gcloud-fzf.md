# [{{page.title}}](https://github.com/sgatewood/gcloud-fzf)

- Go CLI to spotlight gcloud UIs (something I wanted)
- Neat part is you can install it 2 ways:
  ```bash
  go install github.com/sgatewood/gcloud-fzf@latest
  # or
  brew install sgatewood/tap/gcloud-fzf
  ```
- The latter works because of my [homebrew tap](https://github.com/sgatewood/homebrew-tap)
