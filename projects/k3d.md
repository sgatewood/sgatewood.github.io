# [{{page.title}}](https://github.com/sgatewood/k3d)

- Not sure what I plan to do with this yet, but in this repo I can create a [k3d](https://k3d.io/) cluster on my laptop
  - all you have to do is clone the repo, `direnv allow`, and use the `just` recipes
- Could be useful for quickstarting k8s-related projects
