Working on a controller to manage `Job` objects

## Problem / Why

- If you change a `batch/v1` `Job`, tools like Helm fail to apply due to immutable fields. 
- I kinda wish there was a parent object like `Deployment` to recreate `Job` objects on changes (similar to how
`Deployments` recreate `Pods`)
- Of course, the better solution is often to not use `Job` objects at all
  - But sometimes with legacy code in your org this might not be an option, so it'd still be nice to have a better way to deploy them

- Scaffolds the basics so you can focus on your reconciliation logic
